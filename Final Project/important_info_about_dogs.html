            <h2>How to Take a Dog’s Temperature: Do’s & Dont’s</h2>
            <p>Use a digital rectal thermometer designed for pets to accurately take your dog’s temperature. A normal temperature for a dog is between 99.5 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures outside of this range could indicate an underlying health issue that should be addressed by a veterinarian.
                <br>
                <br>
                Check your dog’s temperature for the following reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>To rule out a fever if your dog feels warm.</li>
                    <li>If you suspect your dog is sick.</li>
                    <li>If your dog has spent an extended period of time outdoors in hot weather, especially if showing signs of heat stroke.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            What to Avoid:
            <br>
            If a dog starts squirming or clenching when you try to take his temperature, do not proceed. Trying to take the temperature of an uncooperative dog can cause unnecessary stress, which may lead to aggression. If in doubt, consult a veterinarian prior to taking your dog’s temperature to ensure it is necessary for the situation.

            <h2>10 Tips for Safe Car Travel from Vets </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Keep your pet restrained during the ride. It isn't safe for you or your dog if they are hopping around the car while you're driving. Focus on driving, and your dog may distract you if they get excited or scared.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Airbags are great for you, but they can kill your pet if you have an accident with them in the front seat. Pets should be in the back seat. The safest way for your pet to travel is in a carrier that has been strapped to the seat with a seatbelt or other anchor.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Take several short trips with your dog to get them accustomed to riding in the car before you take off on a long trip. Gradually increase the length of these shorter trips to work up to long-distance travel with dogs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Feed your pet a light meal three to four hours before you leave. While you're on the road, always stop to feed your dog. Don't feed them in a moving vehicle to avoid pet car sickness.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Never leave your dog alone in a parked car. It is a safety concern at temperatures higher than 70°F or lower than 35°F.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pack a travel kit for your pet, including health records, regular food, water, medications, bowls, waste bags, scoop, toys, and a pet first-aid kit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Identify your pet with a collar and ID tag with your home address and cell phone number. For longer trips, get a temporary tag with the phone number of your destination.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don't let your dog ride with their head out the window to avoid risks of debris, collision, or unexpected stops. Follow tip #1 for safe restraint.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Carry your pet's important documents, including a health certificate if traveling across borders, and proof of rabies vaccination.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Bring your own water or provide your dog with bottled water to prevent an upset stomach from drinking water from an unfamiliar source.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Prepare your car for your dog with car seats and floor covers that protect your car and add comfort for your dog, especially if you frequently travel with them.</p>
                </li>
